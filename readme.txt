 * Some people (especially in Europe and Latin America) write a 7     *
 * with a line through the middle, while others (especially in Japan  *
 * and Korea) make the top line crooked.                              *
 *                                                                    *
 * Suppose that the training data consists solely of samples that do  *
 * not use any of these conventions. How well do you think the        *
 * algorithm will perform when you test it on different populations?  *
 * What are the possible consequences?                                *
 **********************************************************************/

ANSWER: The algorithm will have poor performance in predicting and categorizing testing samples into correct
classes. The 7 with a line through the middle will be easily confused with number 2. The 7 with crooked
top line will be likely confused with number 9. Number 2 and 9 will also be confused with number 7.

 * Now suppose that you are using a supervised learning algorithm to  *
 * diagnose cancer. Suppose the training data consists of examples    *
 * solely on individuals from population X but you use it on          *
 * individuals from population Y. What are the possible consequences? *
 **********************************************************************/

ANSWER: The test error rate will be high. There will be many individuals from population Y being misclassified
as cancer patients. There will also be cancer patients in population Y being misclassified as not having cancer.

Yes or no?
Monday TA office hour.
